## Rock, Paper, Scissors!

### Created By. Hunter Hayward and Malcolm Cusack

##### This was a group project to create a HTTPserver/client to run Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
###### for this project I developed and implemented server logic for handling request made by client
###### The request handled reading, writing and evaluating information to files so 2 players could play the game.
###### My partner handled development with client logic and optimizing both server and client to use Json.
###### by using Json my partner was able to clean the code up and make everything simpler and reduce overhead with file manipulation.
